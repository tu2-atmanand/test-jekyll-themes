The second type of filters, are [Board Filters](../How_To/HowToUseBoardSettings.md#Board%20Filters) which allows you to only show the tasks with certain tags in them. You can use this filters to search for few related tasks.

A new type of filters are coming soon, called as Column Filters to filter out tasks under any column.


### Multi-Language Support

The plugin currently supports more than 20 languages and new languages are planned to being  added in subsequent relases. Although a proper care has been taken to translate the default english language to other languages, the exact content meaning cannot be guarenteed, since online services has been used to translation.
Your contribution for updating the current content in any language or adding a new language will be highly appreciated. It will be easy but a powerful step to make this plugin, accessible to many people.
