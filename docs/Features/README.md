# Task Board Features

### Task Formats

This plugin will only detect and work with the checkbox items/tasks which are in a specific format. You can use the other formats to make the plugin ignore those tasks or subtasks.

Checkout in Details here : [Task Formats](Task_Formats.md)

### Adding a Task

There are two way you can add a task to the Task Board. First is the usual old method of directly writing down the task inside the markdown file. The second method is using a **Add New Task** Window to add different properties to the task using input elements to make the adding properties easy and ensuring the format comes properly.

### Applying Filters

At present there are mainly two types of filters. The first one is [Filters for Scanning](docs/Features/Filters_for_Scanning.md), which is a very powerful feature and give you the option to scan only specific folder, file to look out for tasks and also only scan tasks with certain tags on them.
The second type of filters, are [Board Filters](../How_To/HowToUseBoardSettings.md#Board%20Filters) which allows you to only show the tasks with certain tags in them. You can use this filters to search for few related tasks.

A new type of filters are coming soon, called as Column Filters to filter out tasks under any column.

### Multi-Language Support

The plugin currently supports more than 20 languages and new languages are planned to being  added in subsequent relases. Although a proper care has been taken to translate the default english language to other languages, the exact content meaning cannot be guarenteed, since online services has been used to translation.
Your contribution for updating the current content in any language or adding a new language will be highly appreciated. It will be easy but a powerful step to make this plugin, accessible to many people. Read this doc to learn to contribute for Language Translation : [Contribute To Language Translation](../Advanced/Contribution_For_Languages.md).

### Re Scan Vault

This is a Special feature which allows you to re-scan your whole vault to detect any undetected changes or when you update the Scan Filters settings from the Global Settings.
