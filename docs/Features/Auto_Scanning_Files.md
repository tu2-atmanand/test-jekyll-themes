# Auto Scanning

This feature helps you to detect the files you have modified and then scan them automatically to extract any new added task or the old task which you have edited.

This feature can be used two way, which can be controlled using the settings option : [Real-time scanning]().

## Real Time Scanning

Even though it says real-time scanning, its not exactly real-time. Because to optimize the performace we have restricted to only scan the file after use has made some changes and then he saved the file or loose focus from the file.

Scanning the file which you are currently updating in real-time makes no sense, since you will only look at the board after you have made some changes to the markdown file. So, we have used the approach, where are you have edited your file and when you will switch to the Task Board tab, your content will be automatically updated on the board.

This is the default behaviour of this Plugin and its the best approach for scanning the chnages in your vault and updating them on the board in real-time with the least amount of operations and consumption of energy.

But in-case, if you like to keep everything manual and have control over the scanning part. You can use the below method.

## Manual Scanning

If you like to scan the updated file manually and only refresh the board when you want. Then you can turn OFF the [Real-time scanning]() settings option.

Once, you have turned the option OFF, your modified files wont be scanned after you loose focus from the file you have edited or saved. To scan all your updated files, you can go on the Task Board and press the `Refresh` button. This button will scan all the files which you have edited recently and update the changes inside the baord.
