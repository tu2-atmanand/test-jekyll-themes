## How to Update existing Language content

### Manually

- This is a very straight forward method.

- Find the language file which you want to update.
For example, if you language is Czech, then find your language code from this link. In this example the code is 'cs', hence the file name will be `cs.ts`.

- Open this file and find the old string which you want to update.

- Now, simply update the whole string with new content. You can either use online services, but will recommend translating it on your own for better understanding of the content for others.

### Using Automation Script

When you will change any one string from the main en.ts file. Run the script and give all the lines number as argument to the script, which will chnage the line in all the other language files.

## How to add a new Language

### Manually

- Create a new file with the name of your language code and the extension will be '.ts'.
For example, if you language is Czech, then find your language code from this link. In this example the code is 'cs', hence the file name will be `cs.ts`.

- Now opne the file you have just created and create the following structure first before adding your code (preferrably use a better coding editor) :

```
const cs = {

};

export default cs;
```

> NOTE : For you the cs part will be differnt, it will be your Language code.

- Open this file in another tab for your referece : en.ts

- Now, simply replace the english line with your specific laguage line. You can use online translation tools to translate the language. But it will be preferred if you translate the lines in your own words for better understanding of the content.

### Using Automation Script

- Copy the en.ts into another temporary folder.

- Now, create the new language file you want to add, this files name will be the language code and the extension will be '.ts'.
For example, if you language is Czech, then find your language code from this link. In this example the code is 'cs', hence the file name will be `cs.ts`.

- You can add multiple language files at once.

- Now opne the file you have just created and create the following structure first before adding your code (preferrably use a better coding editor) :

```
const cs = {

};

export default cs;
```

> NOTE : For you the cs part will be differnt, it will be your Language code.

- Now, run the script with the argument as 0. It will convert all the english lines with the new language if the language is available in the online service.

- Please Cross check all the strings properly, if the translation of some string doesnt makes sense or havent been translated properly, please translate them into your own words

> NOTE : Also note that, if the language is not supported by the oline service, then all the english strings will be copied as it is into the new file. In this case, you will have to manaually translate ALL the strings into your language.

## How to Submit your file

- After you have completed translation of all the strings properly, submit the file either using pull request to the Github project or directly send the file by creating a GitHub request  here : [How to Create an Request](./HowToCreateRequest.md).
