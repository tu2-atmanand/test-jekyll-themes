# Add A New Task

There are 2 ways at present to add a new task to the board.

## Manual Method

This is a simplest one, old fashioned method, how you normally add a task to any file.
Simply create a supported checkbox Item and start writing your task after the checkbox pattern. On a new line you can add more sub-tasks or description for the task as required.
To understand the supported format for adding a task see this : [Supported Task Fomat](Features/Task_Formats.md).

Also ensure that the file is allowed for scanning and you have not applied any [scanning filters](Features/Filters_for_Scanning.md) for files, folder or tags.

Once you are done with adding all your content, just switch your focus from the current editor to the [Task Board View](../Features/Task_Board_Pane.md) and your task will be automatically added to the Task Board.

## Using Pop-Up Window

You can open the Add New Task pop-up window by searching for the `Task Board : Add New Task in Current File` command from the Command Pallete.

It will be recommended that you add a shortcut to this command, so you can directly add a new task to the current file you are editing.

Ensure that, to run this command, or to open this pop-up window, you are suppose to be inside a markdown file editor. Inside the file place your cursor, where you want to add a new task, and the new task will appear at that line.

## Using Column Buttons

Upcoming Feature...

(You will be able to add a task to a specific allowable column using a button and selecting a file to which you want to add the task to from the pop-up window.)
